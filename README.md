# Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Ukraine Tweets

Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project! This project is part of the 100 Days of Machine Learning challenge, where I dive into various aspects of machine learning and data science. This project marks Day 16, and I am now entering the intermediate phase of the challenge. I am getting into more complex and exciting projects that truly fit my interests and passions.

### Overview

In this project, I analyze the sentiment of 10,000 tweets related to the keyword "Ukraine." Sentiment analysis helps us understand the emotions and opinions expressed in these tweets. This information can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring public opinion, identifying trends, or informing decision-making processes.

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle, and you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/10k-tweets-with-sentiments-dataset).

### Technologies

Various libraries are used, including:

- Pandas for data manipulation
- Numpy for numerical operations
- TextBlob for sentiment analysis
- NLTK and Regular Expressions for natural language processing and data cleaning

### Challenges and Learnings

During this project, I faced some challenges related to data cleaning. Real-world datasets, like the one we used in this project, can contain missing or corrupted data. I had to handle these issues and ensure our sentiment analysis function worked correctly. This experience taught me the importance of preprocessing and cleaning data before diving into any analysis.

### Conclusion

Despite the challenges, I successfully built a sentiment analysis pipeline that analyzes and classifies the sentiment of tweets related to Ukraine. I believe that understanding public sentiment is essential, and this project is a small step towards that goal.

Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or suggest improvements. Let's work together to create a more comprehensive and robust sentiment analysis tool!
